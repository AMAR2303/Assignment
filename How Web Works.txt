				HOW DOES THE WEB WORK?

We have heard “Client-Server Model” many times, but what does it exactly mean?

Let’s start with Client. 
Client is basically the device we use to access internet.
Computers, Laptops etc. are considered clients when the person uses it to surf the web. 
Here the web browser is the most important part.
Each client has a unique IP address, which is used by servers to identify the client.
Now, what’s a server?
It is also a machine whose job is to respond to the requests made by the Client and return the web pages and other files.
Let’s see how the web works.

Whenever we enter a web address in the URL bar of the browser, the URL gets converted into IP address by DNS servers. 
The browser then asks DNS(Domain Name System) servers with the help of our ISP(Internet Service Provider) to lookup
for server linked to the URL we have entered.
DNS identifies the server which serves the URL and sends the details(IP address of the destination server) to the browser 
through the ISP. 
The browser then connects with the server and sends a HTTP request to the server to get the web page of the URL 
we entered.
The web server searches for the web page and sends it back to the browser if it exists. 
The browser then receives the web page and looks for other files/resources required and keeps on making
request until every resource is obtained.
After the above process gets over , the browser finally loads the page and the connection between client 
and server is closed.
